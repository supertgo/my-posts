Context: This is a text representation of one of my presentations that I've made in my current job. There's an event called spotlight, which every week someone has to show something related with the world of programming.

### My Goal on this event

My main goal on this event is to show contents about programming foundation related with the subject that I am currently learning on my college. I truly believe that learning the foundations of the programming subject set is the way to go to be a good professional. Why? If you look at the previous 10 years, there was a lot of change with the programming languages, frameworks, and developer tools, but, the foundations still the same. So, if you understand the core, it will be easy to get into the opportunities that the market provide.

### Plopfile

You can ask: “If you're going to show foundations content, why are you talking about [plopfile](https://plopjs.com/documentation/) (a file generator)?”. I've written three things, and I am going to explain each one separately.

1. **Showing the tool for the rest of my teammates:**
    

The tool was downloaded on two main projects that we work almost every day and me was the only one who knew about it.

1. **Necessity:**
    

As programmers, we know that we have to follow some rules to prevent the code to be a merge of the N ways to code, let N be the number of teammates that you have.

1. **DRY:**  
    One of the most's know programming advices, which means, Don't Repeat Yourself. Why do you have to copy a file and changed it to your custom necessity if you can run a command and make the same thing but within a second?
    

On the next slide, I showed the ways to do the same thing that was one of your main projects. Which one is correct? If a new teammate appears, which way should be followed?

You can argue: “There is no difference between this both ways, on the final result, it will be the same thing, and it's not going to change anything to the end user"

Yes, there is no difference between the code, but why do you have to think about it? Let the computer do manual thing and focus on solve people's problems.

In the next slides, I show the time difference between using a tool to generate your files and doing it manually.

### Conclusion

The conclusion is, instead of doing the same things over and over again, move this task to your computer, focus on writing real code. There are a lot of things that you can automate on your development environment that will boost your productivity on solving a real problem.
